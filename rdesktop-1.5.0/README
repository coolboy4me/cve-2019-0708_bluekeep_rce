===========================================
rdesktop: A Remote Desktop Protocol client.
===========================================

rdesktop is a client for Microsoft Windows NT Terminal Server, Windows 2000
Terminal Services, Windows 2003 Terminal Services/Remote Desktop, Windows XP
Remote Desktop, and possibly other Terminal Services products.
rdesktop currently implements the RDP version 4 and 5 protocols.

Installation
------------
rdesktop uses a typical GNU-style build procedure:

	% ./configure [options]
	% make
	% make install

where documentation for [options] can be found by running "./configure --help".
Usually no options are necessary.  The default is to install under /usr/local,
this can be changed with --prefix=directory.

Invocation
----------

	% rdesktop [options] server

where server is the name of the Terminal Services machine.  Note: if you
receive "Connection refused", this probably means that the server does not have
Terminal Services enabled, or there is a firewall blocking access.

The rdesktop manual page lists the possible options ("man rdesktop").
